# Park Trail Data Analysis and Recommendation System

## Overview

This project involved developing an app using Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze park trail data from various sources (e.g., alltrails.com, nps.gov). We focused on identifying visitation trends in national parks, determining the top 50 trails, and understanding the factors influencing their popularity.

## Components

- **Data Transformation**: Jupyter notebooks containing the cleaning and transformation of datasets, including generating a quantitative composite score to validate our approach.
  
- **Analysis**: SQL queries executed in AWS Redshift, using data from S3 buckets, to achieve desired outcomes. This includes geographical and weather data analysis to recommend underrated state trails similar to popular national trails.

- **Result**: Final analysis and outcomes, presenting a list of underrated trails comparable to the top 50 well-known trails.

- **Main.tex**: Project report compiled in LaTeX.

## Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- AWS (S3, Redshift)
- LaTeX
